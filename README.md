# Adolescent HIV Resource Hub

## Mission Statement

This collaborative, open-source resource guide aims to provide adolescents at risk for or living with HIV, as well as their healthcare providers, with reliable, up-to-date information on local HIV testing sites, youth-friendly clinics, mental health support, PrEP access points, and educational materials.

Our goal is to reduce barriers to care, empower adolescents with knowledge, and foster a community-driven approach to improving health outcomes. By leveraging transparent collaboration on GitHub, we ensure that the guide remains current, accurate, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.

## Target Audience

- Adolescents and young adults (ages 13–24) at risk for or living with HIV
- Healthcare professionals working with adolescent populations
- Community organizations and advocacy groups
- Family members and caregivers seeking reliable resources
